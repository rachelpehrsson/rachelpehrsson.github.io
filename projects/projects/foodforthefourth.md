Food for the Fourth is an organization I founded in 2019 to promote increased donation to food banks in America. For the website, I wanted to make something simple yet eye-catching that would quickly get our point across, but could be easily expanded as the organization grew. I decided to make the website a one-pager for the time being, with the navigation bar transitioning between different sections of the page. I designed the website in Illustrator before I started working. 

<div class = "labeled-image">
<img style = "width:50%" src="/img/fff-website-layout.png" alt="Responsive image">
<div class = "label">The initial design.</div>
</div>

The website was built using AngularJS in order to make it more expandable than a basic static site, particularly in regularly updated sections like our events list. 

From this website, users would be able to read our mission, review our team members, and learn about our past events. To see the website, please visit [FoodForTheFourth.org](http://www.foodforthefourth.org/)
