      <description>My Distinguished Major Project at the University of Virginia was a dynamic quiz system that adjusted practice content based on interaction with the student. It addressed a problem within the computer science department at the University of Virginia, as well as other institutions; the department classroom size is scaling, but the number of TAâ€™s is not expanding at the same rate. Therefore, it is important to test whether certain aspects of personalized help can be automated.</description>

      <title>Food for the Fourth</title>

      <description>Food for the Fourth is an organization I founded in 2019 to promote increased donation to food banks in America. For the website, I wanted to make something simple yet eye-catching that would quickly get our point across, but could be easily expanded as the organization grew. I decided to make the website a one-pager for the time being, with the navigation bar transitioning between different sections of the page. I designed the website in Illustrator before I started working.</description>

      <title>Decoding Nutrition Labels</title>

      <description>Decoding Nutrition Labels is a rule-based cognitive tutor for teaching 6th graders to read nutrition labels on food and glean information about nutrient content. It was built using CTAT, a cognitive tutor authoring tool developed at Carnegie Mellon written in Nools.js.
We based our design on a worksheet that helped students decode nutrition labels and then confirmed the process with a nutrition expert. We used the worksheet in a Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) using 6th grade students and others who had never read an American nutrition label (international students) in order to determine their pain points and preferences.</description>
